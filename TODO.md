## TODOs:

<!-- priority -->

- science api is slow because of free hosting, need to implement loader in signup and login buttons

<!-- normal -->

- make StaticSelect components dropdown align with there
- add validation to login and signup forms and show error message form backend
- create a number input type

<!-- Good to have  -->

- instead of creating snackbar state in each component we can create a HOC and handle snackbar state with redux
